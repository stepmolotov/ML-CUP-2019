# MachineLearning-CUP-2019
In this report we train different models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest
(RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the given dataset. Weâ€™ve analysed performance
and accuracy after choosing the best parameters for each model implementation by using grid
searches and k-fold cross validation. According to our results, the best model
is the one obtained with Extremely Randomized Trees.
